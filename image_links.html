      <p class="robI1">Hello all and welcome to my onewheel shop. I am the father of three great kids, husband to an amazing wife and have been an avid floater for a long time and
      decided to take my passion for onewheel and open up a top of the line shop right here in NWA. Being trained
      by the top of the line onewheel mechanics, there is nothing Naz-T´s float shop can´t handle. You can buy your OneWheel
      here and get it upgraded just the way you want. Keep an eye out for our packages, deals and community ride sessions here in NWA.
      Not sure if you will like it? Come in to the shop for a test ride and we´re sire you will love it. See you soon and float on. <br> -Rob</p>
